## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us privately.

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to `security@swiftv2.example.com` (replace with actual email if available, otherwise "contact the maintainers privately").

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

We prefer that you encrypt your message using our PGP key, if available.

### Disclosure Policy

1.  **Report**: You report the vulnerability to us privately.
2.  **Ack**: We acknowledge receipt of your report.
3.  **Investigate**: We investigate the issue and determine its impact.
4.  **Fix**: We develop a fix for the vulnerability.
5.  **Release**: We release a patched version of the software.
6.  **Disclose**: after the fix has been released and users have had time to update, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability.

We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to fix it and release a patch.
